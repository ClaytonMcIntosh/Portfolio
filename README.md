# React App

This homework was to create a personal portfolio in React. Although I could have copied my previous port-folio over, I really wanted to create the entire site from scratch, using the power of React components. React has some really cool functionality, and I managed to create cards that respond to a single data.js file. If I change the data, or add to it, the website will instantly repopulate. It's very cool! Although this isn't the portfolio I hoped and dreamed, it servers as a base to build on. The learning curve of React is steep. I now feel I understand basic React and to get this far is a huge jump, so I'm happy with the final project. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```

## Responsive App

The app was designed and created mobile-first. Here is the final version on a mobile:

And here is the page responsive on desktop:

## Final App Deployment

As this is an app created in React, the final deployment was a litte tricky. Here is the final destination:
